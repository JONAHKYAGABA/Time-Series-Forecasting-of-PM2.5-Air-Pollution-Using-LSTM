# ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Forecasting of PM2.5 Air Pollution Using LSTM

This project implements a deep learning model using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks to predict PM2.5 air pollution levels over time. It preprocesses time series data, trains a neural network, evaluates performance, and visualizes predictions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Preprocess raw PM2.5 time series data
- Train a TensorFlow/Keras LSTM model
- Evaluate predictions with RMSE
- Visualize actual vs predicted PM2.5 values
- Prepare the model for future deployment
